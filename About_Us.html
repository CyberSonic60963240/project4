		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<body>
		<p>Abandoned and alone, we were evacuated to the hidden village of Knothole in the middle of a warzone caused by the tyrannical overlord Ivo Robotnik, and our home has since been the only part of Mobius that had inexplicably remained standing after Robotnik had steamrolled it to the ground and built a worldwide empire from the ashes. Now, our home is in great danger, and we cannot defend it alone. With your support, we must take back our planet!</p>
