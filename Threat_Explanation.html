It doesn’t matter when, where, or (most importantly) WHY this so-called “overlord” was born, but the trashbag took our world by storm, polluted our air, land, and sea, and left no stone un-roboticized when he made his grand takeover. Now he’s coming after Knothole, and that’s where we DRAW THE LINE. Unfortunately, that line cannot be drawn deep enough if we don’t get some support, and FAST.</p>
